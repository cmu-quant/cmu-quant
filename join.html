<br> <br>Quant Club is committed to giving all CMU undergraduates opportunities to explore the finance industry. There is no application process to join our club; once you've joined our mailing list, you're in! Additionally, our events are open and free to all CMU undergraduates.      

<br> <br> 
Quant Club does not host general body meetings or regular workshops. Instead, we focus on high-impact, high-quality events. Our flagship events are in the spring, and throughout the year, we run smaller events as opportunities arise; we'd love to have you join us!
