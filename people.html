            <h2>Gan Yang</h2>
            <h3><i>President</i></h3>
            <p>
              Gan Yang is a junior from MCS majoring in Computational Finance.
              Since young, he has always found himself drawn to math, puzzles
              and competition, things he knew he would find in the quantitative
              finance industry. Thus, on top of pursuing his interests in pure
              mathematics, he has been actively exploring the field, such as
              through his recent Quantitative Research Internship at Worldquant
              Singapore. As President, he hopes to bolster the quant community
              at CMU as much as those before have inspired him. In his free
              time, Gan enjoys drinking unhealthy amounts of coffee and
              listening to jazz.
