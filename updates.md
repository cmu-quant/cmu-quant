Title:
Maybe just "CMU Quant Club" for now? can put our logo up once we design one

Also put up CMU Math Department and BSCF program details

## About page

Updated summary:

**Quant Club at Carnegie Mellon University** focuses on the study of quantitative finance, more specifically areas in finance where the study of mathematics and other computational aspects are emphasized. In addition, we host events that provide opportunities for members to get familiar with the quantitative finance industry.
Signature events we hold include the **Quantathon**, **Market Making Game**, **Mock Interviews**, **Resume Workshop**, **lecture series**, and *seminars*, etc.

To join the club/subscribe to our mailing list, please do so here: https://lists.andrew.cmu.edu/mailman/listinfo/cmu-quant 
Alternatively, you can email Elena Chen, our VP of Public Relations, at yanbingc@andrew.cmu.edu for request to subscribe.

*[Comment]: I'm thinking about including a few subsections for the events we hold in the about page. What do you think?*


### Quantathon
*Quantathon* brings together students from a variety of backgrounds to tackle interesting and challenging problems in computational finance. 
Quantathon is usually held during the spring semester. For more information on Quantathon in this academic year, please head to our event page (or link here).


One of the founders of Quant Club, Sijie Wei, said:
> We love working around great minds to solve great problems...
> This competition is a great opportunity for students to apply their quantitative skills such as mathematics, probability, statistical analysis and so on in the field of finance. Knowledge in finance was not required, and students with all backgrounds were welcome to participate

One sophomore math major who won the first place in Quantathon 2019, Gunmay Handa, said:
> There’s a sense of satisfaction that comes from putting ideas together from different areas of math and pushing harder and harder until you finally solve it...
> Our solution was very collaborative because there was a lot of probability involved, but there was also combinatorial knowledge you needed in terms of algebraic summations and other techniques we had to apply to evaluate what we came up with.

### Market Making Game
**Market Making Game** is a thought-provoking event combining estimation, negotiation and optimization.
Market Making Game is usually held during both semester. For more information on Quantathon in this academic year, please head to our event page (or link here).

Twenty-five teams started the game with contracts and some (fake) cash. 
Throughout five rounds of play, teams had to use their cash to buy contracts or sell contracts to make more cash. 
However, there was a catch. They didn’t actually know the value of the contracts. 
Instead, each round rotated through questions about the economy, mathematical puzzles and general trivia that teams had to solve to reveal the price of the contracts.

A senior computational finance major, Dallas Foster, said:
> The most challenging part is the uncertainty that comes from not knowing the exact value of the contract and having to trade it anyways if you want any chance to make money
>It wasn’t about whether the traders knew they were 100% right but whether they had a good feeling that they were more right than others. That line of thought applied to the game as well.

*[comment]: let's link the calendar linked w quantclub.cmu@gmail.com here*
*[comment]: will post more updates for this spring's events. For now, we're thinking about mock interviews for sophomores exclusively, quantathon, MMG(not sure), more lectures and seminars, etc.*

## Resources
*[comment]: stress that people should sign up for our mailing list to get most info*

*[comment]: we can put up firm's info session and stuff here later*

*[comment]: oh also, ask Lauren if we can link her website and youtube lecture series here *


## People Page
*[comment]: let's have a standalone people's page? what do you think*

*[comment]: we can ask for people's photos in the chat/get people's linkedin pics*

Everyone’s role: *[comment]: don't need to be super detailed, arrange as you like*
