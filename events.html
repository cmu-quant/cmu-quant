    Quantathon brings together students from a variety of backgrounds to tackle interesting and challenging problems in computational finance. Top teams present their findings to Goldman Sachs recruiters and employees, and winning teams earn thousands of dollars in cash prizes! 
    <br>

    
    
    <blockquote>We love working around great minds to solve great problems... This competition is a great opportunity for students to apply their quantitative skills such as mathematics, probability, statistical analysis and so on in the field of finance. Knowledge in finance was not required, and students with all backgrounds were welcome to participate. <br> --Sijie Wei, Co-Founder of Quant-Club

    The Market Making Game is a thought-provoking event combining estimation, negotiation and optimization. 
    
    Starting the game with contracts and some play cash, your goal  is to use the cash to buy and sell contracts to make a return. However, there is a catch! The exact value of the contract is not given; instead, each round provides questions about the economy, mathematical puzzles and general trivia. Solving these questions reveal the price of the contracts.
    
    
    <blockquote>The most challenging part is the uncertainty that comes from not knowing the exact value of the contract and having to trade it anyways if you want any chance to make money. It wasn’t about whether the traders knew they were 100% right but whether they had a good feeling that they were more right than others! <br> --Dallas Foster, BSCF Alumni  </blockquote>
