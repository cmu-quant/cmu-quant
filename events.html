                Dexter Senft is a mathematician and computer scientist who 
                wandered onto Wall Street in the early 1970s. Back then, 
                transactions took a week or more to process and securities 
                exchanged hands physically, in paper form. PCs would not exist for 
                another decade. Dexter achieved fame by publishing a mathematical 
                explanation of mortgage securities and how to predict their cash 
                flows. He rose to the ranks of senior management at First Boston, 
                Lehman Brothers, and Morgan Stanley. He played an important role 
                in developing the use of computers on Wall Street. He was inducted 
                into the Fixed Income Analyst Society Hall of Fame in 2004.

                You've probably heard of Moore's Law and how computers get 
                exponentially better over time. But have you thought about it in 
                reverse? This talk will illustrate what the early practitioners 
                of quantitative finance had to work with, and how fixed income 
                markets evolved almost in lock-step with practitioners' ability 
                to calculate the values of portfolios and the investment and 
                risk management strategies they could engage in.

                Quantathon is an all-day problem solving competition sponsored 
                by Goldman Sachs. Featuring a $4000 prize pool, teams of 
                participants will come together to work on challenging open-ended 
                problems whose solution will involve the kinds of quantitative 
                skills that are needed in the finance industry. Knowledge of 
                finance is not required.
