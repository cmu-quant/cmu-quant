        <br />
        <p>
          <b>Quant Club at Carnegie Mellon University</b> focuses on the study
          of quantitative finance, more specifically areas in finance where the
          study of mathematics and other computational aspects are emphasized.
          In addition, we host events that provide opportunities for members to
          get familiar with the quantitative finance industry. Signature events
          we hold include the
          <b
            >Quantathon, Market Making Game, Mock Interviews, Resume Workshop,
            lecture series</b
          >, and <i>seminars</i>, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>Quantathon</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          <i>Quantathon</i> brings together students from a variety of
          backgrounds to tackle interesting and challenging problems in
          computational finance. Quantathon is usually held during the spring
          semester. For more information on Quantathon in this academic year,
          please head to our <a href="events.html">event page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>One of the founders of Quant Club, Sijie Wei, said:</p>
        <blockquote>
          We love working around great minds to solve great problems... This
          competition is a great opportunity for students to apply their
          quantitative skills such as mathematics, probability, statistical
          analysis and so on in the field of finance. Knowledge in finance was
          not required, and students with all backgrounds were welcome to
          participate.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          One sophomore math major who won the first place in Quantathon 2019,
          Gunmay Handa, said:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          There’s a sense of satisfaction that comes from putting ideas together
          from different areas of math and pushing harder and harder until you
          finally solve it... Our solution was very collaborative because there
          was a lot of probability involved, but there was also combinatorial
          knowledge you needed in terms of algebraic summations and other
          techniques we had to apply to evaluate what we came up with.

        <h2>Market Making Game</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          <i>Market Making Game</i> is a thought-provoking event combining
          estimation, negotiation and optimization. Market Making Game is
          usually held during both semester. For more information on Quantathon
          in this academic year, please head to our
          <a href="events.html">event page</a>.

        <p>
          Twenty-five teams started the game with contracts and some (fake)
          cash. Throughout five rounds of play, teams had to use their cash to
          buy contracts or sell contracts to make more cash. However, there was
          a catch. They didn’t actually know the value of the contracts.
          Instead, each round rotated through questions about the economy,
          mathematical puzzles and general trivia that teams had to solve to
          reveal the price of the contracts.
        </p>
        <p>A senior computational finance major, Dallas Foster, said:</p>
        <blockquote>
          The most challenging part is the uncertainty that comes from not
          knowing the exact value of the contract and having to trade it anyways
          if you want any chance to make money It wasn’t about whether the
          traders knew they were 100% right but whether they had a good feeling
          that they were more right than others. That line of thought applied to
          the game as well.
