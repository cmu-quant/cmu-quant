    Annie is a junior studying Information Systems and Applied Math. 
    Since a young age, she has been interested in applying 
    quantitative techniques to solve problems, which drew her to the 
    quantitative finance industry. She is also interested in exploring 
    the intersection between technology and finance, especially after 
    having worked an internship as a software engineer at Meta. In her 
    free time, Annie enjoys swimming, skiing, and exploring different 
    restaurants around the city with her friends. She is excited for 
    an amazing year with Quant Club!
